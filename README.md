# CFG: Data & SQL Project

Contains material for a Data & SQL project that I created using MySQL, as part of a course by Code First Girls.

## Course Outline :spiral_calendar:
During the 8-week long introductory course, I learned the basics of MySQL which included:

* creating a database
* database design & management
* modification & retrieval techniques
* data sorting, filtering & aggregation
* joins, subqueries & subset unions
* stored functions & procedures
* triggers & events
* creating & managing views
* backup & restoration
* data visualisation

## Course Project :pencil2:
For the final project I decided to create a database for a first-person shooter game. As well as storing player account details, it also keeps a record of individual in-game performance and has a report system that tracks player reports, with an accompanying ban system.
